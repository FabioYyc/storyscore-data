control: Add option to create multiple PMem namespaces per socket (#8546)\n\nRevamp SCM storage backend as a basis for implementing various changes\r\nincluding handling the situation where PMem has been configured in\r\nAppDirect non-interleaved mode (#8528) and adding\r\n(-S N|--scm-namespaces-per-socket N) option to daos_server storage prepare\r\nsubcommand (where N can take value of 1-8) to enable creation of multiple\r\nPMem namespaces per socket (#8518).\r\n\r\nFor example, on a typical dual-socket platform, the command:\r\ndaos_server storage prepare -s -S 2\r\nWill generate the following PMem block devices:\r\n\/dev\/pmem0 \/dev\/pmem0.1 \/dev\/pmem1 \/dev\/pmem1.1\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n  * Separate prep command logic as precursor to splitting\r\n    daos_server storage prepare into\r\n    daos_server storage (prep-scm|prep-nvme) subcommands in a follow-up\r\n    PR.\r\n  * Improve unit testing by applying appropriate mocking to avoid leaking\r\n    calls into other packages.\r\n  * Improve unit test coverage: server\/storage\/scm 75.8-81.2%,\r\n    cmd\/daos_server 47.9-51.3%, lib\/ipmctl 10.3-56.7%.\r\n  * Provide more informative description of PMem changes made during\r\n    command calls.\r\n  * Provide relevant faults on abnormal situations including resolution\r\n    suggestions.\r\n  * Apply libipmctl major version check and ensure support for v2 & v3.\r\n  * Update admin guide deployment section to document new -S option.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Tom Nabarro

Several debug log statements are changed so that common metadata\r\nrelated log entries are included in the daos default DD_MASK group.\r\nWith this change, all usages of D_DEBUG(DF_DSMS, ...) are changed\r\nto a more appropriate (and in some cases default-enabled) debug log\r\nstream such as:\r\n\r\n- DB_MD (metadata, for code running on pool\/container service engines)\r\n- DB_MGMT (management, for code running on a management service engine)\r\nThe DB_MD logs are enabled by default in DB_GRP1 in the code, so that\r\nwhen then engine log_mask is DEBUG, important pool\/container resource\r\nrelated logging will automatically be included in the engine logs.\r\nSome instances of DB_MGMT are re-categorized to DB_MD as appropriate\r\nfor where the code is running (in pool\/cont service or mgmt engine).\r\n\r\nAlso remove the client-specific macro DF_DSMC used in many D_DEBUG\r\nstatements. This mapped to DB_ANY, an \"uncategorized\" stream of debug\r\nlog messages. The vast majority of these in pool and container libdaos\r\nclient code have now been mapped to DB_MD to reflect in this case that the\r\nclient is interacting with the pool\/container metadata service.\r\nRemaining uses of DF_DSMC are replaced with direct use of DB_ANY.\r\n\r\n2. New DD_MASK groups added for metadata-specific logging use cases\r\nAdd two new \"group\" debug log masks named \"group_metadata_only\" and\r\n\"group_metadata\". These names allow an easy DD_MASK setting to gather\r\nmetadata-relevant (pool and container operations) logging. A use case\r\nis for gathering logging for a bug report if a pool or container\r\ncannot be created or destroyed as expected.\r\n\r\nAn admin may assign the DD_MASK environment variable\r\nto one of these values, in the daos_engine configuration and in\r\nthe client environment. When DD_MASK=group_metadata_only, only\r\nmetadata-specific debug bits will be enabled (mgmt, md).\r\nWhen DD_MASK=group_metadata, the daos default \"group_default\" bits\r\nand the additional non-default metadata (mgmt) bits will be enabled.\r\n\r\nSome functional tests that previously specified engine configuration\r\nDD_MASK=mgmt,md,dsms,any are changed to specify group_metadata_only.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is updated for the new group masks, including adding\r\nsome examples in the common use cases section.\r\n\r\n3. Documentation has been updated and some errors fixed.\r\nA lign debug subsystems\/facilities listed in code and documentation.\r\nAdd existing subsystems to doc, and remove nonexistent ones from doc.\r\nAnd fix some typos (eio -> bio, and DD_LOG_MASK -> D_LOG_MASK).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Kenneth Cain <kenneth.c.cain@intel.com>","sha":"7bbeab78b7cfe9fb93afe21c74598fef53ffcab3","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kccain","username":"kccain"},{"commit_date":"2022-04-01T19:50:41Z","message":"DAOS-10030 doc: fix Doxygen warnings and GHA technical debt.

It includes\r\nthe implementation and functional testing. The following tickets were\r\ncompleted for this feature:\r\n\r\nDAOS-5465: Corrupt BIO Address through VOS\r\nAdd the ability to set a bio address as corrupted using the VOS\r\niter API. This will be necessary for the checksum scrubber\r\nto be able to mark data as corrupted when silent data\r\ncorruption is detected.\r\n\r\nDAOS-6071: Introduced new pool and container properties as defined in\r\ndata_integrity.md\r\n\r\nDAOS-6049: Checksum Scrubber Implementation: It iterates the vos\r\nobjects and for each data value, it will calculate a checksum and\r\ncompare it to the stored checksum. Added CORRUPTION_DETECTED to the\r\nRAS_EVENT_LIST in preparation for raising RAS events. Introduced new\r\ntelemetry metrics. The scrubber is split between two files:\r\nsrv_pool_scrub_ult.c and vos_pool_scrub.c. The \"ult\" file is called\r\nby the server to start the scrubber in its own persistent background\r\nult. The vos file does the actual scanning and scrubbing of the VOS\r\ntree. Added a new test executable (srv_scrubbing_tests) which includes\r\nunit tests for the vos scrubbing functionality.\r\n\r\nDAOS-5467: Auto Evict Pool Target - When the checksum scrubber\r\ndetects enough silent data corruptions to exceed a threshold it will\r\ninitiate a drain on the pool target. Updated the migration system so\r\nthat if it detects a checksum error it will not fail the\r\nmigration\/rebuild but will simply skip that object.\r\n\r\nTesting introduced:\r\n\r\nDAOS-8099: Enabling the scrubber in some basic tests and OSA tests\r\n\r\nDAOS-9318: Target eviction test case\r\n\r\nDAOS-8417 New functional tests for scrubber that read the scrubber\r\ntelemetry metrics and uses fault injection to verify that scrubbing\r\ncan be enabled and that data corruption is detected.\r\n\r\nDAOS-7300: Target auto eviction\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: rpadma2 <ravindran.padmanabhan@intel.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Ryon Jensen <ryon.jensen@intel.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Jeff Olivier <jeffrey.v.olivier@intel.com>","sha":"1ecc5117e056f9b9bc828b86073b470666cdbd7c","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ryon-jensen","username":"ryon-jensen"},{"commit_date":"2022-05-26T16:59:42Z","message":"DAOS-10615 vos: Improvements to Standalone VOS (#9062)\n\nIf standalone VOS is using sys_db then it shouldn't delete the file\r\nbefore creating or on exiting.
